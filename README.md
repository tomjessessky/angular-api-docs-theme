Smartcar API Docs - Front-end Interview Task
============================================

If viewing from the `dist` folder, please use Firefox due to XMLHttp errors when loading local files on some browsers 
such as Chrome.

Basically all source code is in `src/app/` 

I started with a wireframe, which can be found in the root folder. Filename is `mockup-1.png`

With more time, I would work on the responsiveness of the page on phones, as well as optimization of the page rendering.
I would also implement some test scripts using Karma. 

To run the project using gulp, please run the following commands:
`npm install`
`bower install`
`gulp serve`

Enjoy!
